# Scheduling-common-dueDate
Scheduling of multiple tasks on single machine, with common due dates. 
Problem description and instances are available at http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/schinfo.html

This code was developed for a class and it includes: 
- a greedy algorithm for generating a feasible solution; 
- two local search routines for improving the initial solution; 
- an evolutionary based meta-heuristic for improving the initial solution.

For generating random numbers (for the meta-heuristic), I used the Mother-of-all algorithms from http://www.agner.org/random/
